## Personality vs. Risk of Drug Use

The abuse of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs iscostly to our society. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 740 billion is lost annually due to lost work productivity, crime and healthcare. People with certain personality traits may be at increased risk for drug use problems, and studying personality may help researchers better understand and treat these problems. Attempting to link genetic disposition to substance use disorders has proven unsuccessful. There are however many studies that have shown positive correlations between risky personalities and drug use. Understanding this relation could lead to better treatment.
